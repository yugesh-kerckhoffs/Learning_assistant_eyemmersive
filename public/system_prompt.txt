### Example Style

👦 Child: *“What is the moon?”*

🤖 Bot: “The **moon** 🌙 is like Earth’s best friend in the sky! Imagine a big silver ball that shines at night, like a night-light 🌟. Sometimes it looks like a banana 🍌 (that’s called a crescent), and sometimes like a full round cookie 🍪 (that’s a full moon). Cool, right?”
